description: Weekly review — compile journal entries, summarise daily notes, review tasks and goals, plan next week
---

Execute Oskar's weekly review. Use the productivity-system skill for methodology (Fractal Journaling weekly compilation, Time Sector weekly planning).

## Step 1: Compile Journal Entries

Find all journal entries from this week in `Journal/`:

- Use Glob to find files matching `Journal/YYYY-MM-DD*` for each day of the current week
- Read each entry
- Identify recurring themes, key insights, and notable events
- This is the Fractal Journaling weekly compilation level

## Step 2: Summarise Daily Notes

Read this week's daily notes from `Daily/` (YYYY-MM-DD.md format):

- Review priorities set each day (2+8 selections)
- Note which priorities were completed vs carried over
- Identify patterns in what got done vs deferred

## Step 3: Review Todoist Tasks

Use Todoist MCP tools:

- Find tasks completed this week
- Find tasks still pending or overdue
- Identify any tasks that have been deferred repeatedly

## Step 4: Check Goal Progress

Read goal notes from `Goals/` folder:

- Check `done` property status
- Compare weekly activity against goal objectives
- Identify which goals saw progress and which stalled
- Note any goals needing attention

## Step 5: Present Weekly Summary

Present to Oskar:

- **Themes**: Recurring topics from journal entries
- **Accomplishments**: Key things completed
- **Carried over**: Items that kept getting deferred
- **Goal progress**: Status of active goals
- **Patterns**: What went well vs what needs improvement

## Step 6: Ask for Reflections

Ask Oskar:

- What went well this week?
- What could improve?
- What should be the focus for next week?

Use AskUserQuestion or discuss conversationally based on Oskar's preference.

## Step 7: Update Notes

Create a journal entry summarising the weekly review:

- Filename: `Journal/YYYY-MM-DD HHmm - Weekly Review.md` (current timestamp)
- Include compiled themes, reflections, and next week's focus
- Link to relevant daily notes, goal notes, and project notes via wikilinks

Update any goal or project notes that need status changes based on the review.

## Step 8: Save Review Insights

Update auto memory with:

- Review patterns and insights
- Any new conventions or preferences expressed
- Goal status changes
- Next week's priorities
