description: Monthly review — compile weekly summaries, review goals and projects, identify patterns, plan ahead
---

Execute Oskar's monthly review. Use the productivity-system skill for methodology (Fractal Journaling monthly compilation).

## Step 1: Find or Create Monthly Note

Monthly notes use the format `NNN - Month YYYY.md` (e.g., `122 - February 2026.md`).

Check if a monthly note exists for the current month:

- Search in vault root for the current month's note
- If not found, read `Templates/Monthly Note Template.md` and create the note
- The template uses frontmatter: `aliases` (month + year), `previous`/`next` links, `tags: [monthly-notes]`
- Determine the correct NNN prefix by checking existing monthly notes for the sequence

## Step 2: Compile Weekly Summaries

Find weekly review entries from this month:

- Search `Journal/` for entries containing "Weekly Review" in the filename from this month
- Read each weekly review entry
- Extract key themes, accomplishments, and patterns from each week

Compile into a monthly summary section in the monthly note.

## Step 3: Review Goal Progress

Read goal notes from `Goals/` folder:

- Check all active goals (where `done: false`)
- Compare month's activity against goal objectives
- Check quarterly goals — is progress on track for the quarter?
- Identify stalled or blocked goals

## Step 4: Review Project Progress

Read project notes from `Projects/` folder:

- Check `status` property for active projects
- Review related meeting notes and journal entries for project activity
- Note milestones hit and blockers encountered
- Identify projects that need attention

## Step 5: Identify Patterns

From the Fractal Journaling monthly compilation:

- Recurring themes across weeks
- Patterns in what gets done vs deferred
- Energy and productivity patterns
- Emerging interests or shifting priorities

## Step 6: Suggest Adjustments

Based on the review, suggest:

- Goals that may need revised timelines or approaches
- Projects that should be escalated, paused, or closed
- New goals or projects that have emerged from the month's activity
- Habits or workflows that could improve

## Step 7: Ask for Reflections

Ask Oskar:

- What was the highlight of this month?
- What was the biggest challenge?
- What should change going forward?

## Step 8: Update Memory

Save to auto memory:

- Monthly review insights
- Goal and project status changes
- Any pattern-level observations
- Adjustments to conventions or workflow
