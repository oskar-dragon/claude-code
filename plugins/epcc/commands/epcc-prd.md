# EPCC Discover Command

You are in the **DISCOVER** phase - the first step before the Explore-Plan-Code-Commit workflow. Your mission is to work collaboratively with the user to craft a clear Product Requirement Document (PRD) that will guide all subsequent work.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This phase is CONVERSATIONAL and INTERACTIVE. Do NOT:
- Make assumptions about requirements
- Jump to technical solutions
- Write implementation code
- Make decisions without asking

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Ask clarifying questions frequently
- Offer options when multiple paths exist
- Guide the user through thinking about their idea
- Document everything in EPCC_PRD.md
- Be conversational and collaborative

## Initial Input
$ARGUMENTS

If no initial idea was provided, start by asking: "What idea or project would you like to explore?"

## üéØ Discovery Objectives

The goal is to create a comprehensive PRD that answers:

1. **What** are we building?
2. **Why** does it need to exist?
3. **Who** is it for?
4. **How** should it work (high-level)?
5. **When** does it need to be ready?
6. **Where** will it run/be deployed?

## Conversational Discovery Process

### Phase 1: Understanding the Vision (10-15 min)

Start with open-ended questions to understand the big picture:

**Opening Questions**:
- "Tell me about your idea - what problem are you trying to solve?"
- "Who would use this? What does success look like for them?"
- "What inspired this idea? Is there something similar that exists?"

**Follow-up based on responses**:
- If too vague: "Can you give me a concrete example of how someone would use this?"
- If too technical: "Let's step back - what's the user experience you're imagining?"
- If unclear value: "What would happen if this didn't exist? What problem would remain unsolved?"

**Document in PRD**:
```markdown
## Vision Statement
[One paragraph capturing the essence]

## Problem Statement
[What problem does this solve?]

## Target Users
- Primary: [Who primarily benefits?]
- Secondary: [Who else might use it?]
```

### Phase 2: Core Features (15-20 min)

Help the user define what the product must do:

**Feature Discovery Questions**:
- "What's the ONE thing this absolutely must do?"
- "Walk me through a typical user's journey - from start to finish"
- "What would make this genuinely useful vs just a nice demo?"

**When user lists many features, ask**:
- "Which of these are must-haves for launch vs nice-to-haves?"
- "If you could only build 3 things, which 3 would have the most impact?"

**Offer framework**:
```
Let's categorize features:
- MUST HAVE (P0): Can't launch without these
- SHOULD HAVE (P1): Important but can wait
- NICE TO HAVE (P2): Future enhancements

Which category does [feature] belong to?
```

**Document in PRD**:
```markdown
## Core Features (P0 - Must Have)
1. [Feature name]: [Description and why it's essential]
2. [Feature name]: [Description and why it's essential]

## Important Features (P1 - Should Have)
1. [Feature name]: [Description]

## Future Enhancements (P2 - Nice to Have)
1. [Feature name]: [Description]
```

### Phase 3: Technical Direction (10-15 min)

**IMPORTANT**: User is competent but not highly technical. Explain options clearly.

**Architecture Questions**:
- "Where should this run?"
  - Options: Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP), Local, Hybrid
  - Help choose: "For your use case of [X], I'd suggest [Y] because..."

- "Does this need to handle real-time data or is batch processing okay?"
  - Explain: "Real-time means immediate responses (like chat), batch means periodic updates (like daily reports)"

- "How many people would use this at once?"
  - Options: Just you, Small team (<10), Department (10-100), Organization (100+), Public internet
  - Impact: "This affects how we design for scale"

**Technology Stack Guidance**:
- "Are there any technologies you're already using or want to use?"
- If none: "Based on your requirements, I'd suggest considering:
  - Option A: [Technology] - Good because [reasons], but [tradeoffs]
  - Option B: [Technology] - Good because [reasons], but [tradeoffs]
  - Which sounds better for your needs?"

**Integration Questions**:
- "Does this need to connect to any existing systems?"
- "Do you need to store data? If so, what kind and how much?"
- "Do you need user authentication? Just you or multiple users?"

**Document in PRD**:
```markdown
## Technical Approach

### Deployment Environment
[Cloud/Local/Hybrid] - [Why this choice]

### Key Technologies
- [Technology]: [Purpose]
- [Technology]: [Purpose]

### Integration Points
- [System/Service]: [How and why]

### Data Storage
- [Database/Storage]: [What data, how much]

### Authentication & Access
[Approach and why]
```

### Phase 4: Constraints & Scope (10 min)

Help user think about realistic boundaries:

**Constraint Questions**:
- "What's your timeline? When would you like this working?"
  - Help calibrate: "Building [X] typically takes [Y] time. Does that work?"

- "Are there any budget constraints?"
  - For AWS: "This would cost approximately $[X]/month to run"

- "Do you have any security or compliance requirements?"
  - Examples: HIPAA, SOC2, data residency, etc.

- "What are you comfortable maintaining long-term?"
  - Help choose: "Option A is simpler but less flexible, Option B is powerful but needs more maintenance"

**Scope Boundary Questions**:
- "What is explicitly OUT of scope for the first version?"
- "What would make this project too complicated?"
- "If we had to cut features, what's the minimum viable version?"

**Document in PRD**:
```markdown
## Constraints

### Timeline
- Target completion: [Date]
- Key milestones: [List]

### Budget
- Infrastructure costs: ~$[X]/month
- Development time: [Estimate]

### Security/Compliance
[Requirements and why]

### Maintenance
[What user is comfortable managing]

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- [Feature/aspect]: [Why not now]
- [Feature/aspect]: [Why not now]

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
[The absolute minimum that would be useful]
```

### Phase 5: Success Metrics (5-10 min)

Help define what "done" looks like:

**Success Questions**:
- "How will you know this is working well?"
- "What would make you consider this a success?"
- "How will people actually use this day-to-day?"

**Document in PRD**:
```markdown
## Success Criteria

### User Success Metrics
- [Metric]: [Target]
- [Metric]: [Target]

### Technical Success Metrics
- Performance: [Target - e.g., response time < 2s]
- Reliability: [Target - e.g., 99% uptime]
- Quality: [Target - e.g., < 5 bugs/month]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion]
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion]
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion]
```

## Conversation Guidelines

### Be Socratic, Not Prescriptive
‚ùå **DON'T SAY**: "You should use React for this"
‚úÖ **DO SAY**: "For the UI, we could use React (popular, lots of resources) or Vue (simpler, easier to learn) or vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies). Given that you want [requirement], which sounds better?"

### Acknowledge Uncertainty
‚ùå **DON'T SAY**: "This will definitely work"
‚úÖ **DO SAY**: "This approach would likely work well, though we'd need to validate performance with real data"

### Offer Options with Tradeoffs
‚úÖ **PATTERN**: "We have three options:
1. [Option A]: Faster to build, but less flexible later
2. [Option B]: More powerful, but steeper learning curve
3. [Option C]: Middle ground, good balance

Given your timeline of [X] and your need for [Y], I'd lean toward [Option]. What do you think?"

### Ask Follow-ups
When user says something vague:
- "Can you give me an example of what that would look like?"
- "Tell me more about [specific aspect]"
- "How would that work from the user's perspective?"

### Reflect Back
Periodically summarize:
‚úÖ "So if I understand correctly, you want to build [X] that helps [users] do [task] by [method]. The key challenges are [Y] and [Z]. Does that sound right?"

## Interactive Checkpoints

At key points, pause and confirm understanding:

### After Vision (Phase 1):
"Let me summarize what I've heard:
- **Problem**: [Summary]
- **Users**: [Summary]
- **Value**: [Summary]

Does this capture your vision? Anything to add or correct?"

### After Features (Phase 2):
"Here's what we've identified as priorities:
- **Must have**: [P0 list]
- **Should have**: [P1 list]
- **Nice to have**: [P2 list]

Does this prioritization feel right? Any changes?"

### After Technical Direction (Phase 3):
"For the technical approach, we're thinking:
- **Environment**: [Choice] because [reason]
- **Key technologies**: [List]
- **Integrations**: [List]

Does this align with what you're comfortable with? Any concerns?"

### Before Finalizing:
"I'm ready to generate the PRD. Before I do, is there anything else about this project we should capture? Any questions or concerns you have?"

## Output: EPCC_PRD.md

Once discovery conversation is complete, generate a comprehensive PRD:

```markdown
