# EPCC Code Command

You are in the **CODE** phase of the Explore-Plan-Code-Commit workflow. Transform plans into working code.

## Implementation Target
$ARGUMENTS

If no specific task was provided above, check `EPCC_PLAN.md` for the next task to implement.

## ðŸ’» Coding Objectives

1. **Follow the Plan**: Implement according to EPCC_PLAN.md
2. **Apply Patterns**: Use patterns identified in EPCC_EXPLORE.md
3. **Write Clean Code**: Maintainable, tested, documented
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider what could go wrong
5. **Ensure Quality**: Test as you code

## Extended Thinking Strategy

- **Simple features**: Focus on clarity
- **Complex logic**: Think about edge cases
- **Performance critical**: Think hard about optimization
- **Security sensitive**: Ultrathink about vulnerabilities

## Parallel Coding Subagents

Deploy specialized coding agents concurrently:
@test-generator @optimization-engineer @security-reviewer @documentation-agent @ux-optimizer

- @test-generator: Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD approach)
- @optimization-engineer: Optimize algorithms and queries during implementation
- @security-reviewer: Validate security as code is written
- @documentation-agent: Generate inline documentation and API docs
- @ux-optimizer: Ensure user experience best practices in implementation

Note: Review patterns in EPCC_EXPLORE.md and follow the plan in EPCC_PLAN.md if they exist.

## Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Review Context
```bash
# Review exploration findings
cat EPCC_EXPLORE.md

# Review implementation plan
cat EPCC_PLAN.md

# Check current task status
grep -A 5 "Task Breakdown" EPCC_PLAN.md
```

### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[task-name]

# Set up test watchers
npm test --watch  # or pytest-watch

# Open relevant files
code src/[relevant-files]
```

### Step 3: Test-Driven Development (if --tdd flag)
```python
# 1. Write failing test first
def test_new_feature():
    result = new_feature(input_data)
    assert result == expected_output

# 2. Run test to confirm it fails
pytest test_new_feature.py

# 3. Write minimal code to pass
def new_feature(data):
    return process(data)

# 4. Refactor while keeping tests green
```

### Step 4: Implementation Patterns

#### Pattern: Input Validation
```python
def process_data(input_data):
    # Always validate inputs
    if not validate_input(input_data):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    
    # Process with confidence
    return transform(input_data)
```

#### Pattern: Error Handling
```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    return fallback_value
finally:
    cleanup_resources()
```

#### Pattern: Logging
```python
logger.info(f"Starting process for {item_id}")
logger.debug(f"Processing with params: {params}")
logger.error(f"Failed to process: {error}")
```

## Code Quality Checklist

### Before Writing Code
- [ ] Understand requirements from EPCC_PLAN.md
- [ ] Review similar code patterns
- [ ] Set up test environment
- [ ] Plan error handling

### While Coding
- [ ] Follow project conventions
- [ ] Write self-documenting code
- [ ] Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- [ ] Handle edge cases
- [ ] Log important operations

### After Coding
- [ ] Run all tests
- [ ] Check code coverage
- [ ] Run linters
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Review for security issues

## Common Implementation Patterns

### API Endpoint Implementation
```python
@app.route('/api/resource', methods=['POST'])
@authenticate
@validate_input
def create_resource():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        resource = ResourceService.create(data)
        return jsonify(resource), 201
    except ValidationError as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 400
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to create resource: {e}")
        return jsonify({'error': 'Internal error'}), 500
```

### Database Operations
```python
def save_to_database(data):
    with get_db_connection() as conn:
        try:
            conn.begin()
            result = conn.execute(query, data)
            conn.commit()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            conn.rollback()
            raise DatabaseError(f"Save failed: {e}")
```

### Async Operations
```python
async def process_async(items):
    tasks = []
    for item in items:
        task = asyncio.create_task(process_item(item))
        tasks.append(task)
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    return [r for r in results if not isinstance(r, Exception)]
```

## Integration with Other Phases

### From PLAN:
- Follow task breakdown from EPCC_PLAN.md
- Implement according to technical design
- Meet acceptance criteria

### To COMMIT:
- Ensure EPCC_CODE.md is complete
- All tests passing
- Code review ready

## Final Steps

1. Update `EPCC_CODE.md` with implementation details
2. Run final test suite
3. Perform self-review
4. Prepare for commit phase

Remember: **Clean code is written once but read many times!**
