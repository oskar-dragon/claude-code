# EPCC Plan Command

You are in the **PLAN** phase of the Explore-Plan-Code-Commit workflow. Transform exploration insights into actionable strategy.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This phase is for PLANNING ONLY. Do NOT write any implementation code. Focus exclusively on:
- Creating detailed plans
- Breaking down tasks
- Assessing risks
- Documenting everything in EPCC_PLAN.md

All implementation will happen in the CODE phase.

## Planning Target
$ARGUMENTS

If no specific feature or task was provided above, ask the user: "What feature or task would you like to plan?"

## 📋 Planning Objectives

1. **Define Clear Goals**: What exactly are we building?
2. **Design the Approach**: How will we build it?
3. **Break Down Work**: What are the specific tasks?
4. **Assess Risks**: What could go wrong?
5. **Set Success Criteria**: How do we know we're done?

## Extended Thinking Strategy

- **Simple features**: Standard task breakdown
- **Complex features**: Think about edge cases and interactions
- **System changes**: Think hard about ripple effects
- **Architecture decisions**: Ultrathink about long-term implications

## Parallel Planning Subagents

Deploy specialized planning agents you have access to:
@system-designer @tech-evaluator @business-analyst @security-reviewer @qa-engineer @project-manager

**Agent Instructions**: Each agent must ONLY plan and document. Save all implementation for the CODE phase:
- @system-designer: Design system architecture and component interactions (NO CODING - only design)
- @tech-evaluator: Evaluate technology choices and build vs buy decisions (NO IMPLEMENTATION)
- @business-analyst: Break down requirements into manageable tasks (NO IMPLEMENTATION)
- @security-reviewer: Assess risks and identify potential vulnerabilities (NO FIXES - only identify)
- @qa-engineer: Plan comprehensive testing strategy (NO TEST WRITING - only strategy)
- @project-manager: Calculate realistic timelines and resource allocation (PLANNING ONLY)

MOTE:
- You can find details about the codebase in EPCC_EXPLORE.md if it exists.
- You can find details about Product Requirements in EPCC_PRD.md if it exists.

## Planning Framework

### Step 1: Define Objectives

```markdown
## Feature Objective

### What We're Building
[Clear, concise description]

### Why It's Needed
[Business value and user benefit]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1: Measurable outcome
- [ ] Criterion 2: Measurable outcome
- [ ] Criterion 3: Measurable outcome

### Non-Goals (What We're NOT Doing)
- Not implementing X (will be done later)
- Not changing Y (out of scope)
- Not optimizing Z (separate task)
```

### Step 2: Design the Approach

```markdown
## Technical Approach

### High-Level Architecture
```
[Component A] --> [Component B] --> [Component C]
     |                |                  |
     v                v                  v
[Database]      [Cache Layer]      [External API]
```

### Design Decisions
| Decision | Option Chosen | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Database | PostgreSQL | Need ACID compliance |
| Caching | Redis | Fast, supports our data types |
| Auth | JWT | Stateless, scalable |

### Data Flow
1. User initiates request
2. System validates input
3. Process business logic
4. Update database
5. Return response
```

### Step 3: Task Breakdown

Use TodoWrite to create trackable tasks (DO NOT implement these tasks now - only document them):

```python
tasks = [
    {
        "id": "1",
        "content": "Set up database schema",
        "estimate": "2 hours",
        "dependencies": [],
        "priority": "high"
    },
    {
        "id": "2", 
        "content": "Implement authentication middleware",
        "estimate": "3 hours",
        "dependencies": ["1"],
        "priority": "high"
    },
    {
        "id": "3",
        "content": "Create API endpoints",
        "estimate": "4 hours",
        "dependencies": ["1", "2"],
        "priority": "medium"
    }
]
```

### Step 4: Risk Assessment

```markdown
## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Database migration fails | Low | High | Create rollback script, test in staging |
| API rate limits exceeded | Medium | Medium | Implement caching, request batching |
| Performance degradation | Low | High | Load testing, monitoring, optimization plan |
| Security vulnerability | Low | Critical | Security review, penetration testing |
```

### Step 5: Test Strategy

```markdown
## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Model validation tests
- [ ] Service logic tests
- [ ] Utility function tests
- Coverage target: 90%

### Integration Tests
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] Database interaction tests
- [ ] External service mock tests
- Coverage target: 80%

### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] User workflow tests
- [ ] Error scenario tests
- [ ] Performance tests
- Coverage target: Critical paths

### Security Tests
- [ ] Authentication tests
- [ ] Authorization tests
- [ ] Input validation tests
- [ ] SQL injection tests
```

```

## Planning Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Break tasks into < 4 hour chunks
- ✅ Include testing in every task
- ✅ Consider edge cases explicitly
- ✅ Document design decisions
- ✅ Plan for rollback

### DON'T:
- ❌ Skip risk assessment
- ❌ Underestimate complexity
- ❌ Ignore dependencies
- ❌ Plan without exploration
- ❌ Forget documentation tasks

## Planning Checklist

Before proceeding to CODE phase, ensure all plans are documented in `EPCC_PLAN.md`.

**REMINDER**: No code should be written during this phase. If you're tempted to implement something, document it as a task instead:

- [ ] Objectives clearly defined
- [ ] Approach thoroughly designed
- [ ] Tasks broken down and estimated
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Risks assessed and mitigated
- [ ] Test strategy defined
- [ ] Success criteria established
- [ ] Documentation planned
- [ ] Timeline realistic
- [ ] Resources available

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic planning
/epcc-plan "Plan user authentication feature"

# Detailed planning with risk assessment
/epcc-plan --detailed --with-risks "Plan payment processing"

# Quick planning for small feature
/epcc-plan --quick "Plan UI tooltip addition"

# Planning with specific focus
/epcc-plan --focus backend "Plan API refactoring"
/epcc-plan --focus security "Plan security improvements"
```

## Integration with Other Phases

### From EXPLORE:
- Use exploration findings from `EPCC_EXPLORE.md`
- Reference identified patterns from exploration
- Consider discovered constraints

### To CODE:
- Provide clear task list in `EPCC_PLAN.md`
- Define acceptance criteria in plan document
- Specify test requirements

### To COMMIT:
- Reference `EPCC_PLAN.md` in commit message
- Update documentation
- Include plan details in PR description

## Final Output

Upon completion, generate `EPCC_PLAN.md` containing:
- Implementation overview and objectives
- Technical approach and architecture
- Complete task breakdown with estimates
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Testing strategy and success criteria
- Dependencies and timeline

Remember: **A good plan is half the implementation!**

🚫 **DO NOT**: Write code, create files, implement features, or fix bugs
✅ **DO**: Plan, document, design, assess risks, break down tasks, and save everything to EPCC_PLAN.md
