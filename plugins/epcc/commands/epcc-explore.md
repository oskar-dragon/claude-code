# EPCC Explore Command

You are in the **EXPLORE** phase of the Explore-Plan-Code-Commit workflow. Your mission is to understand thoroughly before taking any action.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This phase is for EXPLORATION ONLY. Do NOT write any implementation code. Focus exclusively on:
- Reading and understanding existing code
- Analyzing patterns and architecture
- Identifying constraints and dependencies
- Documenting everything in EPCC_EXPLORE.md

All implementation will happen in the CODE phase. Use the following subagents in parallel for this explore phase:

## Parallel Exploration Subagents

IMPORTANT: Use the following subagents in parallel for this explore phase:
@code-archaeologist @system-designer @business-analyst @test-generator @documentation-agent

**Agent Instructions**: Each agent must ONLY explore and document findings. Save all implementation ideas for the CODE phase:
- @code-archaeologist: Analyze legacy code structure and uncover hidden patterns (NO CODING - only analysis)
- @system-designer: Identify design patterns and architectural conventions (NO IMPLEMENTATION - only observation)  
- @business-analyst: Map dependencies and process flows (NO CHANGES - only documentation)
- @test-generator: Explore existing tests and coverage gaps (NO TEST WRITING - only assessment)
- @documentation-agent: Review and analyze all documentation (NO NEW DOCS - only review)

Note: This is the first phase - findings will be documented in EPCC_EXPLORE.md for use in subsequent phases. Always check for CLAUDE.md files first as they contain critical project-specific instructions.


## Exploration Focus
$ARGUMENTS

If no specific area was provided above, perform a general exploration of the entire codebase. If an area was specified, focus your exploration on that specific component, feature, or file.

## üîç Exploration Objectives

1. **Review Project Instructions**: Check for CLAUDE.md files with project-specific guidance
2. **Map the Territory**: Understand project structure and architecture
3. **Identify Patterns**: Find coding conventions and design patterns
4. **Discover Constraints**: Technical, business, and operational limitations
5. **Review Similar Code**: Find existing implementations to learn from
6. **Assess Complexity**: Understand the scope and difficulty

## Extended Thinking Strategy

- **Quick exploration**: Basic project overview
- **Deep dive**: Think about architectural decisions and patterns
- **Complex systems**: Think hard about interdependencies and side effects
- **Legacy code**: Ultrathink about historical context and migration paths


## Exploration Methodology

### Step 1: Review Project Instructions (CLAUDE.md)
```bash
# Check for CLAUDE.md files with project-specific instructions
# These files contain critical project conventions and requirements

# Check for project-level CLAUDE.md
if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
    echo "Found project CLAUDE.md - reviewing project-specific instructions"
    cat CLAUDE.md
fi

# Check for .claude/CLAUDE.md
if [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
    echo "Found .claude/CLAUDE.md - reviewing additional instructions"
    cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
fi

# Check for user's global CLAUDE.md
if [ -f "~/.claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
    echo "Found global CLAUDE.md - reviewing user preferences"
    cat ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
fi
```

### Step 2: Project Structure Analysis
```bash
# Get high-level overview
tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|__pycache__|.git|dist|build'

# Identify key directories
ls -la src/ tests/ docs/ config/

# Find main entry points
grep -r "if __name__ == '__main__'" . --include="*.py"
grep -r "export default" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"
```

### Step 3: Technology Stack Discovery
```bash
# Identify frameworks and libraries (READ ONLY - do not modify any files)
# Check for package files
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then echo "Found Node.js project"; fi
if [ -f "requirements.txt" ]; then echo "Found Python project"; fi
if [ -f "Gemfile" ]; then echo "Found Ruby project"; fi
if [ -f "pom.xml" ]; then echo "Found Java project"; fi
if [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then echo "Found Rust project"; fi
if [ -f "go.mod" ]; then echo "Found Go project"; fi

# Document findings in EPCC_EXPLORE.md, do not create new files
```

### Step 4: Pattern Recognition
```bash
# Identify coding patterns (OBSERVATION ONLY - do not implement any patterns)
# Look for architectural patterns
grep -r "Controller" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" | head -10
grep -r "Service" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" | head -10
grep -r "Repository" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" | head -10

# Document patterns found in EPCC_EXPLORE.md
# DO NOT create new pattern implementations
```

### Step 5: Constraint Identification
- Performance requirements (latency, throughput)
- Security requirements (authentication, encryption)
- Compatibility requirements (browsers, platforms)
- Regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA)
- Technical debt and limitations

### Step 6: Similar Implementation Search
```bash
# Find similar features or patterns
grep -r "authentication" --include="*.py" --include="*.js"
grep -r "similar_feature_name" --include="*.py" --include="*.js"

# Look for existing solutions
find . -name "*auth*" -o -name "*login*" -o -name "*session*"
```

## Exploration Checklist

Before proceeding to PLAN phase, ensure all findings are documented in `EPCC_EXPLORE.md`.

**REMINDER**: No code should be written during this phase. If you discover issues or have implementation ideas, document them in EPCC_EXPLORE.md for later phases:

- [ ] CLAUDE.md files reviewed and understood
- [ ] Project structure fully mapped
- [ ] All dependencies identified
- [ ] Coding patterns documented
- [ ] Similar implementations reviewed
- [ ] Constraints clearly understood
- [ ] Risks and challenges assessed
- [ ] Testing approach understood
- [ ] Deployment process reviewed
- [ ] Documentation reviewed
- [ ] Team conventions identified (including CLAUDE.md instructions)

## Interactive Exploration Mode

```bash
# Start interactive exploration
/epcc-explore --interactive

# This will prompt:
1. What aspect to explore? [structure/patterns/dependencies/tests]
2. How deep? [quick/thorough/exhaustive]
3. Focus area? [backend/frontend/database/all]
```

## Common Exploration Patterns

### For New Features
1. Find similar existing features
2. Understand the current architecture
3. Identify integration points
4. Review relevant tests

### For Bug Fixes
1. Locate the problematic code
2. Understand the surrounding context
3. Find related code that might be affected
4. Review existing tests for the area

### For Refactoring
1. Map current implementation
2. Identify all dependencies
3. Find all usages
4. Understand test coverage

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic exploration
/epcc-explore

# Focused exploration
/epcc-explore --focus authentication
/epcc-explore --focus database --deep

# Specific file exploration
/epcc-explore --file src/auth/login.py

# Pattern search
/epcc-explore --patterns MVC,REST

# Dependency analysis
/epcc-explore --dependencies
```

## Integration with Next Phases

The exploration phase outputs in `EPCC_EXPLORE.md` feed directly into:
- **PLAN**: Use findings from EPCC_EXPLORE.md to create realistic plans
- **CODE**: Reference patterns and conventions documented in EPCC_EXPLORE.md
- **COMMIT**: Ensure consistency with project standards identified in EPCC_EXPLORE.md

## Final Output

Upon completion, generate `EPCC_EXPLORE.md` containing:
- Executive summary
- Project structure analysis
- Key components and patterns
- Dependencies and constraints
- Risks and recommendations
- Complete exploration checklist

Remember: **Time spent exploring saves time coding!**

üö´ **DO NOT**: Write code, create files, implement features, fix bugs, or modify anything
‚úÖ **DO**: Read, analyze, understand, document findings, and save everything to EPCC_EXPLORE.md
