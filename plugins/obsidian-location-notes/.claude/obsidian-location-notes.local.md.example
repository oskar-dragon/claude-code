# Obsidian Location Notes Configuration

This file configures the obsidian-location-notes plugin for your Obsidian vault.

## Required Settings

### vault_path
**Type:** String (absolute path)
**Required:** Yes
**Description:** Absolute path to your Obsidian vault directory

**Example:**
```yaml
vault_path: /Users/john/Documents/ObsidianVault
```

**How to find your vault path:**
1. Open Obsidian
2. Go to Settings → About
3. Look for "Vault path" or note the location
4. Use the absolute path (e.g., `/Users/john/Documents/MyVault`)

### notes_folder
**Type:** String (relative path)
**Required:** Yes
**Description:** Subfolder within your vault where location notes will be created

**Example:**
```yaml
notes_folder: Maps/Locations
```

**Notes:**
- Path is relative to vault root
- Folder will be created if it doesn't exist
- Can use nested folders (e.g., `Travel/Locations`)
- Don't include leading or trailing slashes

## Optional Settings

### google_maps_api_key
**Type:** String
**Required:** No
**Description:** Google Maps Geocoding API key for enhanced location data

**Example:**
```yaml
google_maps_api_key: AIzaSyD1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrs
```

**When to use:**
- You have a Google Cloud account
- You want the most accurate geocoding results
- You're looking up commercial locations frequently

**How to get an API key:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable "Geocoding API"
4. Create credentials → API Key
5. (Recommended) Restrict key to Geocoding API only
6. Copy key and paste here

**Cost:**
- Google provides free tier ($200/month credit)
- Geocoding: $5 per 1000 requests after free tier
- See [Google Maps Pricing](https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/pricing)

**Without API key:**
- Plugin will use free OpenStreetMap Nominatim service
- Still provides accurate coordinates for most locations
- No cost, no signup required

## Setup Instructions

1. **Copy this file:**
   ```bash
   cp .claude/obsidian-location-notes.local.md.example .claude/obsidian-location-notes.local.md
   ```

2. **Edit the settings:**
   - Replace `/Users/yourname/path/to/obsidian/vault` with your actual vault path
   - Set `notes_folder` to where you want location notes created
   - (Optional) Add Google Maps API key if you have one

3. **Verify configuration:**
   - Make sure vault path exists
   - Ensure you have write permissions to the vault
   - Test by creating a location note

## File Location

This settings file should be located at:
```
.claude/obsidian-location-notes.local.md
```

**Important:**
- This file is gitignored (contains your personal paths and API keys)
- Do not commit this file to version control
- Each user/machine needs their own copy with their settings

## Example Configurations

### Minimal Configuration (No API Key)
```yaml
---
vault_path: /Users/sarah/Documents/MyVault
notes_folder: Locations
---
```

### Full Configuration (With Google Maps API)
```yaml
---
vault_path: /Users/sarah/Documents/TravelVault
notes_folder: Travel/LocationNotes
google_maps_api_key: AIzaSyABC123...xyz
---
```

### Work Configuration (Shared Vault)
```yaml
---
vault_path: /Volumes/SharedDrive/TeamVault
notes_folder: Research/Locations
---
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Plugin settings not found" error
- Create `.claude/obsidian-location-notes.local.md` from this example
- Verify file is in correct location
- Check YAML frontmatter syntax is valid

### "Vault path doesn't exist" error
- Verify the path in `vault_path` is correct and absolute
- Check for typos in the path
- Ensure you have read/write permissions
- On macOS/Linux, path is case-sensitive

### "Notes folder not found" error
- Plugin will attempt to create the folder automatically
- Verify you have write permissions to vault
- Check `notes_folder` path doesn't start or end with slashes

### Google Maps API not working
- Verify API key is correct (no extra spaces)
- Check Geocoding API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Verify API key isn't restricted to specific IPs/domains
- Plugin will fallback to OpenStreetMap if API fails

## Privacy & Security

**API Keys:**
- Never commit API keys to version control
- This file is in `.gitignore` by default
- Restrict Google Maps API key to Geocoding API only

**Vault Path:**
- Contains personal file paths
- Safe to use absolute paths (not shared publicly)
- File is local to your machine

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Verify settings file exists and has correct YAML
2. Check paths are absolute and valid
3. Test vault path by navigating to it in terminal/finder
4. See plugin README for additional troubleshooting
