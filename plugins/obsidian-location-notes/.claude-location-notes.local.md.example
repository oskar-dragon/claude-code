# Obsidian Location Notes Configuration

This file configures the obsidian-location-notes plugin.

## Required Settings

- **vault_path**: Absolute path to your Obsidian vault directory
- **save_location**: Directory within vault where location notes should be saved (relative to vault root)

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy this file to `.claude/obsidian-location-notes.local.md` in your project
2. Update `vault_path` with your actual Obsidian vault path
3. Update `save_location` with your preferred directory (e.g., "Maps", "Locations", "97 - MAPS")

## Examples

### macOS with Google Drive
```yaml
vault_path: "/Users/yourname/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-email@gmail.com/My Drive/Obsidian/My Vault"
save_location: "97 - MAPS"
```

### macOS with iCloud
```yaml
vault_path: "/Users/yourname/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/My Vault"
save_location: "Locations"
```

### Windows with Google Drive
```yaml
vault_path: "C:/Users/yourname/Google Drive/Obsidian/My Vault"
save_location: "Maps"
```

### Linux
```yaml
vault_path: "/home/yourname/Documents/Obsidian/My Vault"
save_location: "Locations"
```

## Notes

- Use absolute paths for `vault_path`
- Vault path should point to the root of your Obsidian vault
- Save location is relative to the vault root
- Directory will be created if it doesn't exist
- This file should be added to `.gitignore` as it contains local paths
