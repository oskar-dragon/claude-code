# Diataxis Explanation Command

You are in the **EXPLANATION** phase of the Diataxis documentation workflow. Your mission is to create understanding-oriented documentation that provides context, background, and deeper insights into concepts, designs, and decisions.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This command is for creating EXPLANATORY documentation ONLY. Focus exclusively on:
- Providing conceptual understanding and context
- Explaining the "why" behind decisions
- Discussing alternatives and trade-offs
- Offering broader perspectives and connections
- Documenting everything in `docs/explanation/[topic-slug].md`

## Concept to Explain
$ARGUMENTS

If no specific concept was provided above, ask the user: "What concept, architecture, or design decision would you like explained in depth?"

## ü§î Explanation Objectives

1. **Deepen Understanding**: Provide context and background
2. **Explain Rationale**: Why things are the way they are
3. **Discuss Alternatives**: What other approaches exist
4. **Make Connections**: How concepts relate to each other
5. **Provide Perspective**: Historical and future context

## Extended Thinking Strategy

- **Simple concepts**: Clear analogies and examples
- **Complex systems**: Think about relationships and interactions
- **Design decisions**: Think hard about trade-offs and constraints
- **Architectural choices**: Ultrathink about long-term implications

## Parallel Explanation Subagents

Deploy concurrent documentation specialists:
@docs-explanation-agent @architecture-documenter @system-designer @business-analyst

All subagents work in parallel to create comprehensive explanations:
- @docs-explanation-agent: Create conceptual, understanding-oriented content
- @architecture-documenter: Document design decisions and rationale
- @system-designer: Explain system architecture and patterns
- @business-analyst: Provide business context and requirements background

## Explanation Documentation Framework

  Storage                  Output
```
```

### Step 4: Design Decisions

```markdown
## Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### Decision: [Specific Choice Made]

   - Cons: [Drawbacks]
   - Why chosen: [Reasoning]

2. **Option B**
   - Pros: [Benefits]
   - Cons: [Drawbacks]
   - Why not: [Reasoning]

3. **Option C**
   - Pros: [Benefits]
   - Cons: [Drawbacks]
   - Why not: [Reasoning]

#### Trade-offs Accepted
- We prioritized [quality] over [quality]
- We accepted [limitation] to gain [benefit]
- We chose [approach] knowing [consequence]

#### Future Considerations
- This decision allows for [future possibility]
- We may revisit if [condition changes]
- Migration path exists to [alternative]
```

### Step 5: Relationships and Connections

```markdown
## How This Relates to Other Concepts

### Relationship to [Related Concept 1]
[Explain connection and interaction]

### Relationship to [Related Concept 2]
[Explain connection and interaction]

### Part of Larger System
```
[Broader Context]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [This Concept]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Related System]
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Connected Component]
```

### Dependencies
- Depends on: [What this needs]
- Depended on by: [What needs this]
- Interfaces with: [What it connects to]
```
