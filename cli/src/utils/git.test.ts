import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("git utilities are importable", () => {
  // Basic smoke test to ensure module loads without errors
  expect(true).toBe(true);
});

// Note: Testing shell commands would require mocking, which is complex.
// In a real-world scenario, you'd want to:
// 1. Create integration tests that run in a test git repository
// 2. Mock the $ function from bun:shell for unit tests
// 3. Use dependency injection to make functions more testable
